# NBA Draft Board

This is a web application designed to help the Dallas Mavericks with the 2025 NBA Draft, taking place on June 25th.

The main feature of the web app is a draft board, which is the ranking of the top 60 players in the draft. On the main page, you can see the players ranked 1-60, with the most important data in the table as well (name, school, age, and height). If you click on any player name, you will see a side bar with much more data on the player.

In the side bar, you can see the player photo (if they have one) as well as their season stats and stats per game (Points, Assists, Rebounds, etc.). You can also see their rankings from different journalism outlets, if the outlets have them ranked (there are 5 total outlets, but only ESPN has all 60 ranked). From this ranking, a "draft spot" is assessed based on how they are ranked by all applicable outlets. Lastly, there are scouting reports available to see on the side bar. There aren't many of these, however the user can choose to add some themselves if they wish.


Additionally, there are two features available for the user on the website

### Add Scouting Report

As stated before, the user can add a scouting report on any player they like. Via a button at the top, the user can choose the player, enter their name as the scout, and write their report on the player. This will then appear on the side bar of the corresponding player.

### Filter Players

The other button filters the players in the main table, and the user has two options on how they want to sort the players. First, they can pick any of the available colleges to see what players are ranked from that college. The other option is to filter the players based on their experience. While many players come from NCAA colleges, a lot of players come from foreign leagues or the NBA G-league, and you can filter the table so you can see only the collegiate or pro-league players.
